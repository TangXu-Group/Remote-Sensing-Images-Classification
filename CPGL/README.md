## Install dependencies
    pytorch>=1.7.1
## Data
We conduct the experiments on four data sets, including UC Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and RSSDIVCS. To train and test our model, you should 
    download the data set and modify image's path according to your needs.
## Training
All the configurations are in `main.py`, and you can modify them by your needs.

#### train the model
    ./main.sh
